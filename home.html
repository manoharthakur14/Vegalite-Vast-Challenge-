      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The presence of toxic industrial waste in the water affects the natural habitat of The Pipit
          bird and other wild life.An implication is been made from the data that new dumping sites like Tansanee and Somchair  
          are being created which can be held responsible for pollution. But, due to inconsistancy of sampling records and lack of 
          vital information like flow of rivers and its acidic properties,it is  difficut to
          gain more insights. Measuring the flow rate might help to understand if a chemical's dilution is being 
          exacerbated from upstream or downstream and at the same time, provide an indication for the flow direction too. 
          This will help to also understand the presence of any choke points, where the flow of a river is taking a long time 
          from point A to B, thereby leading the birds or wildlife being directly affected by the streams. The altitude of the 
          sampling points can also be an estimate for flow direction. Water properties such as pH and conductivity can also be 
          measured.
</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">In a nutshell, our recommendation is to target the right and relevant measurements, and 
          measure them consistently across locations by adopting similar routes. If the readings of the sensors are automated, 
          then all that is needed is to schedule the recordings in a cohesive time interval. We hope that the hydrology 
          department can take our suggestions in their future endeavors.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">A few preprocessing step where required which are mentioned below</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">For the chemicals measured in mg/l, they are converted to micro g/l to aid
           in comparison.Water temperature, which is a physical property has different unit of measurement as compared to the 
           rest.To avoid the scaling problems in faucets,while oberving different chemicals togeather,they were created as indiviual csv files.
           Min-Max normalization is applied when more than one chemicals were compared against each other.
